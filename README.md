# MyCourses App

MyCourses is an application that allows a user (student) to search the CS courses catalogue (similar to SIS API) and organize courses into three categories:

* Taken: a course user has already taken (in the past)
* Enrolled: a course user is currently taking (in the present)
* Interested: a course user would like to take later (in the future)
